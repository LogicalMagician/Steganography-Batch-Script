This batch script allows you to hide a text file inside an image using AES encryption, so that the text is not easily visible or accessible to others. The script uses PowerShell to encrypt and decrypt the text, and the certutil command to hide and extract the text from the image.

How to use the script
Download the batch script to your local computer.

Double-click the script to open it in a command prompt.

When prompted, choose whether you want to hide text or extract text from the image.

If you choose to hide text, enter the name of the image file and the text file to hide, and then enter a password to encrypt the text.

If you choose to extract text, enter the name of the output file and the password used to secure the image.

The script will perform the chosen operation and display a message when it is done.

Note: The image file that contains the hidden text will have the same name as the original image file, with ".jpg" added to the end.
